This is a **practice project** developed as part of my learning journey in frontend development.

Initial version of a Snap site clone, built for practicing HTML and CSS. Will be improved and extended in the future

⚠️ **Disclaimer**:  
This project is NOT affiliated with Snapp in any way.  
All assets used (icons, layout, structure) are intended only for learning and demonstration purposes.
